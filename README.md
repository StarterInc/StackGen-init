# StackGen-init
Initialization repository for new StackGen projects

This is a template project which contains the project structure required to create and launch a new StackGen app.

To get started:

```
git clone https://github.com/StarterInc/StackGen-init/.git <your-project-name>
```

Once you have the repo downloaded, cd into the folder and run:

```
bash launcher.sh
```

This will download the latest StackGen executable Jar file from Maven Central and execute it with test settings.
